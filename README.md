# CRS_GENAI

CRS_GENAI is a lightweight, modular data query pipeline that converts user questions into SQL queries, executes them on a database, and returns the results. It is designed for quick metric extraction with few-shot LLM assistance, without dynamic segments or insights.

## 🚀 How It Works

The pipeline is linear, simple, and easy to follow. Here’s the step-by-step workflow:

1. **User Input**
   - The user types a question, e.g.,  
     `"Portfolio outstanding for branch IN0010097?"`

2. **Clean and Understand the Question**
   - **Rephrase**: Normalizes the question using `rephrase_question`.
   - **Add Keywords**: Ensures important terms are included.
   - Keywords are deduplicated for clarity.

3. **Pick What Data You Need**
   - **Identify Tables**: Uses `identify_intent` to select relevant tables.
   - **Identify Columns**: Uses `identify_columns` to find required columns.
   - Columns and keywords are added to the pipeline DTO.

4. **Fix Table Names**
   - **Correct Typos**: Uses `correct_tables` to fix any table name errors.
   - Only tables that exist in the reference metadata are kept.

5. **Validate Tables and Columns**
   - Ensures that all selected tables and columns are valid and consistent with the database reference.

6. **Build SQL**
   - **Join Instructions**: Determines how tables should be joined using `get_joining_instructions`.
   - **SQL Generation**: Uses `generate_sql_from_dto` with LLM + few-shot resources (FAISS, BM25, embeddings) to create the SQL query.

7. **Run SQL**
   - Executes the generated SQL using `execute_sql`.
   - Stores the response in the DTO.

8. **Return Results**
   - Converts the DTO to a dictionary and returns it to the user/UI.
   - Logs all steps for auditing (`save_master_record`, `save_child_records`).

## 📦 Key Features

- **Linear and Modular**: Easy-to-follow steps from user question → SQL → results.
- **Few-Shot LLM Assistance**: SQL generation uses previous examples for better accuracy.
- **Validation & Fuzzy Correction**: Ensures table and column names are correct.
- **Auditing**: Logs every step including tokens, execution time, and results.
- **DTO-Centric**: All metadata, tables, columns, SQL, and results are stored in a single `PipelineDTO` object.

## 🧠 Memory Hack / Visual Metaphor

Think of the pipeline like **ordering a pizza**:

1. You ask for a pizza → **User Question**
2. Chef clarifies your order → **Rephrase Question + Add Keywords**
3. Chef picks ingredients from pantry → **Select Tables & Columns**
4. Pantry labels are corrected → **Correct Table Names**
5. Chef checks ingredient freshness → **Validate Tables & Columns**
6. Chef prepares the pizza → **Generate SQL + Join Instructions**
7. Chef bakes it → **Execute SQL**
8. Pizza is served → **Return Results + Audit**

## ⚡ Usage

```python
from pipeline.pipeline import run_pipeline

question = "Portfolio outstanding for branch IN0010097?"
result = run_pipeline(question, username="akash")
print(result)
